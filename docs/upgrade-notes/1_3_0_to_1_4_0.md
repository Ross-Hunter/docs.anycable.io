# Upgrading from 1.3.x to 1.4.0

This document contains only the changes compared to v1.3.x releases. For the new features see the [release notes](../release_notes.md).

## Upgrade process

You can upgrade Ruby gems and Go server in any order. However, if you want to migrate to the new broadcasting architecture, you should follow the steps described below.

## AnyCable-Go

### Disconnect mode

We introduce new configuration option, `--disconnect_mode`, in favor of `--disable_disconnect`. The new option has three possible values: "auto" (default), "never" and "always". If you used `--disable_disconnect`, you should either switch to `--disconnect_mode=never` or remove the option and use the default one depending on your use case.

See [documentation](../anycable-go/configuration.md#disconnect-events-settings) for more details.

## Rails/Ruby
