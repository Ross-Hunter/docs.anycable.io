# Upgrading from 1.4.x to 1.5.0

This document contains only the changes compared to v1.4.x releases. For the new features see the [release notes](../release_notes.md).

## Upgrade process

You can upgrade AnyCable server and your backend SDK (Ruby, JS) in any order. As soon you upgrade both, you can migrate your secrets (see below).

## Secrets management

TBD

## AnyCable Rails

### JWT

The `anycable-rails-jwt` has been merged into `anycable` and `anycable-rails` gems. Remove `anycable-rails-jwt` from your Gemfile.

If you used `AnyCable::Rails::JWT` module explicitly in your code, update it to `AnyCable::JWT` and pass identifiers as a Hash:

```diff
- AnyCable::Rails::JWT.encode(current_user:, expires_at: 10.minutes.from_now)
+ AnyCable::JWT.encode({current_user:}, expires_at: 10.minutes.from_now)
```

### Configuration changes

Some configuration parameters has been renamed as follows:

- `http_broadcast_secret` -> `broadcast_key`
- `jwt_id_key` -> `jwt_secret`
- `jwt_id_ttl` -> `jwt_ttl`
- `jwt_id_param` -> `jwt_param`

## AnyCable-Go

### Configuration changes

Some configuration parameters has been renamed as follows:

- `http_broadcast_secret` -> `broadcast_key`
- `jwt_id_key` -> `jwt_secret`
- `jwt_id_ttl` -> `jwt_ttl`
- `jwt_id_param` -> `jwt_param`
- `jwt_id_enforce` -> `enforce_jwt`
- `turbo_rails_key` -> `turbo_secret` + `turbo_streams`
- `cable_ready_key` -> `cable_ready_secret` + `cable_ready`

Older parameter names are still supported but deprecated and will be removed in v2.
