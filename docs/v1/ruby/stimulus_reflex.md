# Using with Stimulus Reflex

AnyCable v1.0+ works with Stimulus Reflex with some additional considerations:

- For Stimulus Reflex <3, you should add `persistent_session_enabled: true` to your configuration (e.g., `anycable.yml`)
- Stimulus Reflex 3+ persists session by itself but requires you to use a cache store for sessions. **Using memory store is not compatible with AnyCable**. Memory store is only accessible by the owner process, and with AnyCable you have two processes at least (web server and RPC server). Thus, you need to use a distributed cache store such as Redis cache store.
