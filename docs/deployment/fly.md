# Fly.io Deployment

> ðŸŽ¥ Check out this [AnyCasts episode](https://anycable.io/blog/anycasts-rails-7-hotwire-and-anycable/) to learn how to deploy AnyCable applications to [Fly.io][fly]

The recommended way to deploy AnyCable apps to [Fly.io][fly] is to have two applications: one with a Rails app and another one with `anycable-go` (backed by the official Docker image).

## Deploying Rails app

Follow the [official documentation][fly-docs-rails] on how to deploy a Rails app.

Then, we need to configure AnyCable broadcast adapter. Check out the [official docs][fly-docs-redis] on how to create a Redis instance. **Don't forget to add `REDIS_URL` to your app's secrets**

Finally, we need to add an AnyCable RPC server.

### Standalone RPC process (default)

You can define multiple processes in your `fly.toml` like this:

```toml
[processes]
  web = "bundle exec puma" # or whatever command you use to run a web server
  rpc = "bundle exec anycable"
```

Don't forget to update the `services` definition:

```diff
  [[services]]
-   processes = ["app"]
+   processes = ["web"]
```

**NOTE**: Keep in mind that each process is executed within its own [Firecracker VM](https://fly.io/docs/reference/machines/). This brings a benefit of independent scaling, e.g., `fly scale count web=2 rpc=1`.

### Embedded RPC

You can run RPC server along with the Rails web server by using the embedded mode. This way you can reduce the number of VMs used (and hence, reduce the costs or fit into the free tier).

Just add the following to your configuration:

```toml
[env]
  # ...
  ANYCABLE_EMBEDDED = "true"
```

Embedding the RPC server could help to reduce the overall RAM usage (since there is a single Ruby process), but would increase the GVL contention (since more threads would compete for Ruby VM).

### RPC configuration

To make RPC accessible from other applications, you must add the following env variable:

```toml
[env]
  ANYCABLE_RPC_HOST = "0.0.0.0:50051"
```

Also, since we rely on [client-side load balancing](./load_balancing.md), it's worth adding a max live time for gRPC connections. In your `anycable.yml`:

```yml
production:
  # ...
  server_args:
    max_connection_age_ms: 60000
```

## Deploying AnyCable-Go

To deploy AnyCable-Go server, we need to create a separate Fly application.
Following [the official docs][fly-multiple-apps], we should do the following:

- Create a `.fly/applications/anycable-go` folder and use it as a working directory for subsequent commands:

```sh
mkdir -p .fly/applications/anycable-go
cd .fly/applications/anycable-go
```

- Run the following command:

```sh
fly launch --image anycable/anycable-go:1 --no-deploy --name my-cable
```

- Create a configuration file, `fly.toml`:

```toml
app = "my-cable" # use the name you chose on creation
kill_signal = "SIGINT"
kill_timeout = 5
processes = []

[build]
  image = "anycable/anycable-go:1"

[env]
  PORT = "8080"
  ANYCABLE_HOST = "0.0.0.0"

[experimental]
  allowed_public_ports = []
  auto_rollback = true

[[services]]
  http_checks = []
  internal_port = 8080
  processes = ["app"]
  protocol = "tcp"
  script_checks = []
  [services.concurrency]
    # IMPORTANT: Specify concurrency limits
    hard_limit = 10000
    soft_limit = 10000
    type = "connections"

  [[services.ports]]
    handlers = ["tls", "http"]
    port = 443

  [[services.tcp_checks]]
    grace_period = "1s"
    interval = "15s"
    restart_limit = 0
    timeout = "2s"
```

- Add `REDIS_URL` obtained during the Rails application configuration to the _cable_ app:

```sh
fly secrets set REDIS_URL=<url>
```

Now you can run `fly deploy` to deploy your AnyCable-Go server.

## Linking Rails and anycable-go apps

Finally, we need to _connect_ both parts to each other.

At the Rails app side, we need to provide the URL of our WebSocket server. For example:

```toml
[env]
  # ...
  CABLE_URL = "my-cable.fly.dev"
```

And in your `production.rb` (added automatically if you used `rails g anycable:setup`):

```ruby
Rails.application.configure do
  # Specify AnyCable WebSocket server URL to use by JS client
  config.after_initialize do
    config.action_cable.url = ActionCable.server.config.url = ENV.fetch("CABLE_URL", "/cable") if AnyCable::Rails.enabled?
  end
end
```

At the AnyCable-Go side (`fly.anycable.toml`), add the RPC host to the env variables:

```toml
[env]
  # ...
  ANYCABLE_RPC_HOST="dns:///lhr.my-app.internal:50051"
```
