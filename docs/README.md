AnyCable helps you build reliable and fast real-time featuresâ€”notifications, chats, Hotwire frontends, and moreâ€”natively on Ruby on Rails without using 3rd-party services. Stay productive by writing clean, maintainable code in Ruby with the assurance that your application scales efficiently.

Save up to 10x on infrastructure compared to built-in Action Cable without sacrificing Rails productivity by switching to third-party services: a fast Golang server handles the load, a gRPC-driven Rails application deals with business-logic. The [Pro version](./pro.md) offers even more benefits: an additional 40% reduced memory footprint, DX improvements, and priority support.

Besides from being Action Cable-compatible, AnyCable comes with an exclusive set of features, including [reliable streams](./anycable-go/reliable_streams.md), [JWT authentication](./anycable-go/jwt_identifications.md), etc.
